# Color Generator
Simple Color Generator app using jQuery. The app chooses three random numbers(variables "r", "g", and "b" in script.js file) and uses those random numbers to generate a new RGB color when the box is clicked.

## Future Plans
- Copy color to clipboard by pressing button
- User stores their "favorite" colors
- See others favorite colors
